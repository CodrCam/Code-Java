# JoinHashMaps

JoinHashMaps is a Java application that demonstrates the operation of joining two HashMaps. It provides an easy way to understand and visualize how LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN operations work in SQL, represented here using Java HashMaps.

## Application Overview

The application consists of the following main components:

1. `JoinHashmaps` class: This class contains the main method `join` which performs the LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN operation on two input HashMaps.
2. `JoinHashmapsTest` class: This class contains JUnit test cases for the `join` method in `JoinHashmaps`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Java JDK 8 or later
- Maven or Gradle
- JUnit 5 for running the tests

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/CodrCam/Code-Java.git>
    cd <Code-Java>
    ```

2. To build and run the project, use your preferred IDE or the command line.

3. To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal: `gradle test`

## Usage

1. Run the `JoinHashmaps` class with two HashMaps and a join type ('left' or 'right') as arguments.
2. The results of the join operation will be output as a list of lists.
